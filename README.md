# Polish & Bloom Website

This is the official website for Polish & Bloom, a self-help and financial wellness space for women who want clarity, confidence, and cashflow.

## üöÄ Running Locally

To view the website on your local machine, you can simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

For a more realistic development environment, you can use a local web server. If you have Python installed, you can run the following command in the project root:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Alternatively, you can use `npx` to run a live server:

```bash
npx live-server
```
